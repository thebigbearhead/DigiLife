# Personal Terminal Scripts (The Shell Toolbox)

This repository serves as a personal archive for my custom terminal scripts, aliases, functions, and configuration snippets. These scripts are designed to automate repetitive tasks in my post-production and design workflow, streamline development processes, and generally make my time in the terminal more efficient and enjoyable.
